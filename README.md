Comparing different Embeddings 

This repository takes an initiative in comparing the effect of different Embeddings on the performance of text classification Model. We'll begin with basic bag-of-words approach , tf-idf and NN-based Word2vec, Fasttext, DBOW, PV-DM. 

Data used for the purpose of analysis corresponds to news classification dataset from Kaggle. It is a classic text classification problem in which text has to be classified into one of the categories.
